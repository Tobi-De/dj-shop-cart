## Development

Poetry is required (not really, you can set up the environment however you want and install the requirements
manually) to set up a virtualenv, install it then run the following:

```sh
poetry install
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Tests can then be run quickly in that environment:

```sh
pytest
```
